#Sustainable Development 

Studies show that malnutrition can be prevented through a set of tried and tested interventions particularly during the critical window of the first 1000 days of a child's life. Also, "improving women's nutrition before, during, and after pregnancy; promoting and supporting exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of child's life and continued breastfeeding to age 2 or beyond; facilitating high-quality complementary foods; and providing appropriate micronutrient interventions" [1]. We want to create an inclusive educational website that clearly lists the main problems that cause malnutrition, and deep dive into why and how the problems occur. Then we hope to propose a sustainable plan to nourish communities with sustainable practices that can be implemented locally and daily.  
The UN Goal we chose to focus on is UN Goal 2: Zero Hunger, and the subgoal we aim to propose a plan for is:

	1	2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.

##Reason

With our website, we hope to educate the correct personal in the suffering communities who in turn will educate members of the community on proper practices to slowly eradicate the problem of malnutrition. 

##Impact

To create communities that have the proper knowledge to effectively sustain adequate nutrition.
