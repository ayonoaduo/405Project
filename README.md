# Sustainable Development 

The UN Goal we chose to focus on is UN Goal 2: Zero Hunger, and the sub goal we aim to propose a plan for is:
   1.	2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5         years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.

Studies show that malnutrition can be significantly prevented through implementing good breastfeeding practices starting from the start of a child’s life up to two years and beyond. We want to create progressive web app that allows community workers in the affected communities to keep track of the progress being made on the good breastfeeding practices in their own communities. The PWA will allow community workers to keep track of the progress of each mother and child through consistent questionnaires and comments that can be viewed in a graphical way to see the change in progress over time. Through tracking the progress in every community, we hope that it can help the community workers and supervisors make informed decisions on what is working and what is not, or request more resources if needed. Furthermore, the data collected through our PWA would help United Nations in understanding how the information that is being taught on breastfeeding is being received and implemented through different communities all around the world.

## Reason

With our website, we hope to educate the correct personnel in the suffering communities who in turn will educate members of the community on proper practices to slowly eradicate the problem of malnutrition. Our website will allow for further collaboration with our Northstar customers once they get involved. They will be able to provide an update on each section of the website as new research, statistics, and modules are created.  

## Impact

With Project Vitality we hope to create communities that have the proper knowledge to effectively sustain adequate nutrition.

## Who

The audience we intend to reach with our project are as follows:

1. UN Educators: Individuals that contribute to research, module creation, and teaching of that information to the community educators
2. Community Educators: Typically live in the community that is affected. They are taught the relevant info by the UN educators and given the appropriate tools to help the communities. The community educators also track the progress of the community on a regular basis and report back to the UN Educators on what’s working and what's not so the UN educators can adjust education and plan of actions accordingly.
3. The Locals: The individuals that are part of the impacted community and thus helped by the Community Educators and UN educators.
