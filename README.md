# Sustainable Development 

The UN Goal we chose to focus on is UN Goal 2: Zero Hunger, and the sub goal we aim to propose a plan for is:
   1.	2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5         years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.

Studies show that malnutrition can be significantly prevented through implementing good breastfeeding practices from the start of a childâ€™s life up to two years and beyond. We want to create a progressive web app that allows community workers to keep track of the progress being made on the correct breastfeeding practices. The PWA will allow community workers to keep track of the progress of each mother and child through consistent questionnaires and comments that can be viewed in a graphical way to see the change in progress over time. Through tracking the progress in every community, we hope that it can help the community workers and supervisors make informed decisions on what is working and what is not, or request more resources if needed. Furthermore, the data collected through our PWA would help the United Nations in understanding how the information that is being taught on breastfeeding is being received and implemented through different communities all around the world. 


## Reason

With our PWA, we hope to create a tool for the community workers that allows them to see and track the progress of each mother and child in their community.  

## Impact

The data collected through our PWA would help the United Nations in understanding how the information that is being taught on breastfeeding is being received and implemented through different communities all around the world. 

## Who

The audience we intend to reach with our project is the community workers. This PWA will help them track the progress of their own communities and report back the data to their supervisors to request more resources.
